## Install

     $ npm install --save @gmod/genericseqpanel

## Usage

This React component creates a div containing highlighted FASTA DNA sequence. It uses as its input materials an NCList (i.e., a JBrowse 1 GFF3 formated dataset) anda bgzip, faidx indexed FASTA file.  It addition to those data sources, the component must also be supplied these items about the location:

* the name of the reference sequence (eg, "Chr1")
* the start and end coordinates (technically in interbase coordinates, but since the lookup is going to be an overlaps-type query, the details don't really matter if base versus interbase coordinates are used)
* the name of the gene and transcript for which the highlighted fasta is required
* the "mode" of highlighting required (more on that below)
